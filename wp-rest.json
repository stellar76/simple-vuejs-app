They also employ special audio mixes to better tie sound effects to video action. The combination of speaker placement and sound engineering creates a unique harmony of motion between sound and vision.<\/p>\n<p>That same effect would be a cool addition to your home theater, but few people want to embed a bunch of speakers in their ceiling. The next best thing is probably <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wired.com\/tag\/samsung\/\">Samsung\u2019s<\/a>new Dolby Atmos home system, which packs that same dramatic effect into a traditional soundbar, a pair of wireless rear speakers, and a subwoofer. It uses the same hardware-based decoding tech as big theater rigs, so when you\u2019re watching a Dolby Atmos-mastered movie, you get to take advantage of the same object-based sound engineering found in the cineplex.<\/p>\n<h3>Audio Acrobatics<\/h3>\n<p>The HW-K950 system simulates the effect of having speakers embedded in your ceiling. And does a remarkable job too, thanks to four upwards-firing 2.5-inch drivers\u2014two on the soundbar and one on each of the rear speakers. The unique speaker design rebounds sound off of the ceiling and down toward your head, and it really does sound like things are raining down from on high.<\/p>\n<p>The soundbar has left-center-right channels like any other unit out there, but the upward-firing speakers represent two more channels. There are two more \u201coverhead\u201d channels in the wireless rear speakers, as well as two more traditional channels. So while there are just four units in the package, Samsung cheekily bills it as a 5.1.4 system: Five surround-sound channels, one subwoofer, and four channels that bounce audio off your ceiling.<\/p>\n<p>All told, there\u2019s a whopping 500 watts of power spread across the whole system\u2014about 25 times the power of your average TV\u2019s built-in speakers. A 160-watt amp in the 8-inch sub, nine 2.5-inch drivers spread across the soundbar and rear speakers, and a 35mm wide-range tweeter in the soundbar unit. That makes it nearly four times as powerful as the only other Atmos-friendly soundbar we\u2019ve seen, the<a href=\"http:\/\/usa.yamaha.com\/products\/audio-visual\/digital-sound-projector\/ysp-5600_u\/\">Yamaha YSP-5600<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Feed It Right<\/h3>\n<p>While Samsung says the system will \u201cupmix\u201d audio from non-Atmos sources to give it the around-and-above treatment, it\u2019s better if you pick gear and content from the Atmos world. You\u2019ll need a source that can decode and output Dolby Atmos content, which could be a Blu-ray player, receiver, game console, TV, PC, or streaming box. You\u2019ll also need Dolby Atmos-mastered content, which Samsung says will be available on Blu-ray, 4K Blu-ray, and services such as Vudu, Netflix, and Amazon. You can get<a href=\"http:\/\/www.dolby.com\/us\/en\/experience\/dolby-atmos\/bluray-and-streaming.html\">Atmos-mastered titles on Blu-ray<\/a> right now like <em>Mad Max: Fury Road<\/em>, <em>Game of Thrones<\/em>, and <em>The Fifth Element<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Soundbars are usually a cheap way to upgrade your home-theater audio experience, but this Atmos-enabled system is an exception. The HW-K950 is priced at $1,500 and will go on sale this summer, while a step-down HW-K850 system will sell for $1,000. While the lower-priced HW-K850 has the same upward-facing speakers in the soundbar, the wireless rear speakers aren\u2019t part of the package.<\/p>\n"

You have two minutes.<\/p>\n<p>Gianluca Gimini has over the past six years asked more than 500 people to do exactly this. Drawing a bicycle from memory is harder than it sounds; of the 370 people who really tried (Gimini says a lot of people go rogue, when they realize their drawings aren\u2019t turning out right), about 25 percent managed to accurately sketch a bike.<\/p>\n<p>Gimini doesn\u2019t pay attention to the accurate\u00a0drawings in his illustration project\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.gianlucagimini.it\/prototypes\/velocipedia.html\" target=\"_blank\">Velocipedia<\/a>. Instead, he created digital renderings of some of the weirdest, most impractical designs that came from the other 75 percent of the test group. \u201cPeople draw some really crazy stuff when they are trying to be totally non-creative and just follow a task,\u201d he\u00a0says.<\/p>\n<p>The idea started with a conversation in a bar in Bologna, Italy, in 2009. Gimini was recounting a childhood memory about a classmate who was asked to draw a bicycle, on the spot, in front of the entire class. He couldn\u2019t, which seemed laughable. After all, bicycles are ubiquitous objects that most kids learn to ride at a young age. It\u2019s a machine that\u2019s been passed down generations, and its utility transcends geography and culture. \u201cWe both agreed that [everyone]\u00a0knows how a bike is made,\u201d Gimini says. \u201cBut then [my friend] tried to draw one on a napkin, and he failed.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Gimini\u2019s experiment isn\u2019t the first of its kind. A\u00a0psychologist from the University of Liverpool even conducted <a href=\"http:\/\/road.cc\/content\/blog\/90885-science-cycology-can-you-draw-bicycle\" target=\"_blank\">a test<\/a> that challenged people to draw a bicycle from memory. And you may remember that BuzzFeed article from 2013, \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/www.buzzfeed.com\/adamellis\/heres-what-happens-when-you-ask-people-to-draw-maps-of-the-u#.upAMvBaM7M\" target=\"_blank\">Here\u2019s What Happens When You Ask People To Draw A Map Of The USA From Memory<\/a>.\u201d (What happens is people can\u2019t do it.)<\/p>\n<p>Both surveys, while funny, made\u00a0humans look like clueless morons. Gimini\u2019s project doesn\u2019t do that. By putting an artistic spin on the\u00a0drawings, his project is instead a celebration of the ways people can be accidentally creative. In this way, it\u2019s similar\u00a0to a project that made the rounds online in 2014, when a high school student in San Antonio, Texas, asked strangers to draw a map of the world. He used Photoshop to create a composite map using 30 maps he collected in the survey. His assignment, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/international\/archive\/2014\/01\/what-you-get-when-30-people-draw-a-world-map-from-memory\/282901\/\" target=\"_blank\">according to <em>The Atlantic<\/em><\/a>, was to create\u00a0\u201ca piece of art that would reveal something unseen.\u201d\u00a0The result was a Rorschach inkblot that fused 30 perspectives into one graphic.<\/p>\n<p>Gimini\u2019s life-like illustrations have a similar charm, like you\u2019re peering into a hidden nook of someone\u2019s imagination. \u201cA single designer could not come up with so many variations on a single theme if he worked on it all his life,\u201d Gimini says.<\/p>\n"
